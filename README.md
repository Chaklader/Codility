	CODILITY
	————————
	
	The repo is for the solutions of the problems in the Codility platform. Generally, Codility
	problems are comprehensive, formed with multiple arguments and helps to improve the abstract
	thinking. However, unless specified, these problems may not be suitable to prepare for the
	general coding interviews.
	
	I haven't write the solutions and are primarily collected for the educational purpose.
	However, I refactored the code and modified the logic if necessary. Occasionally, I don't
	find the solutions over online and write them myself. Obviously, These solutions are free
	to use. I will attain some tournament and update the repo overtime.
